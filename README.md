# $\chi^2$ minimization search
This repository contains general utility functions to perform $\chi^2$ minimization-searches over a set of synthetic data.

The function `get_best_fit` performs a 1D minimization search and takes as parameter the x and y values of the goal function and a iteratible object to search over it.
